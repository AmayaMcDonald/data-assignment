		<p> The rate of chronic absenteeism in NYC schools has reached 41% in the last school year, according to the latest <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/operations/downloads/pdf/mmr2022/2022_mmr.pdf"> Mayor’s Management Report. </a> Chronic absenteeism is reported when a student is missing 10%, or at least 18 days, of school in an academic year. Despite the return of fully in-person learning, students in NYC schools missed more school in 2022 than they did in years before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

			<p> Absentee rates in academic years between 2016 and 2020 have been generally consistent. However, there are disparities in absenteeism among students of different socioeconomic statuses. Kim Nauer, a researcher at The New School, explained that parents in low income households could have difficulty getting their children to school regularly. "Middle income, high income homes, they're homes that are organized around the idea that their kids have to go to school," Nauer said."In some low income homes, school is equal priority with other things that this parent might have going on. So it's just not as it's not as easy to make time."
